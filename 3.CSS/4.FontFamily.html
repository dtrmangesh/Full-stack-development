        <p>Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda,
            which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the
            cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.

            Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers,
            with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the
            largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
